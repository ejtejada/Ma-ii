# Ma-ii
Ma'ii (mąʼii) is a natural language processing program to change text to defeat Adversial Context Machine Emergence (ACME) systems that compare likeness of input text to past papers.
ACME systems compare input texts to databases composed of published papers and all past text submitted to the unique ACME system in question.

We will use a Keras and word and context detecting libraries in Python to replace words and alter sentence structures so we can defeat similarity tests.
